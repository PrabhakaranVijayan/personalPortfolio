        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Apple Titan, widely known as Apple’s ambitious automotive project, aimed to disrupt the electric vehicle (EV) market with a focus on self-driving technology and innovation. Despite Apple's proven track record of success in product design and technology, the Titan project has faced significant challenges since its inception. This case study delves into the root causes behind these challenges and identifies actionable insights.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</h2>
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Strategic Unstability</h3>
          <p>
            Symptoms: The project’s shifting focus between building a car and creating autonomous software confused stakeholders and diluted efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Root Cause: A lack of clarity in long-term goals and priorities resulted in resource allocation challenges and misaligned team efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contributing Factors: Limited experience in the automotive industry and an overly ambitious timeline without concrete milestones.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Leadership Instability</h3>
          <p>
            Symptoms: Departure of key executives like Steve Zadesky and Doug Field disrupted progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Root Cause: Misalignment between the leadership team and Apple’s overarching corporate strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contributing Factors: Internal conflicts regarding project direction and pressure to meet unrealistic expectations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Talent Drain</h3>
          <p>
            Symptoms: Loss of top-tier engineers to competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Root Cause: Intense competition in the EV and autonomous vehicle market made it difficult to retain talent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contributing Factors: Perception of slower progress compared to Tesla and Waymo, coupled with limited incentives to stay.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Supply Chain Bottlenecks</h3>
          <p>
          Symptoms: Delays in securing key automotive components, including batteries and
           sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
          Root Cause: Lack of existing relationships in the automotive supply chain, unlike
competitors who had established partnerships.

          </p>
          <p>
          Contributing Factors: Apple’s traditional reliance on its in-house design philosophy
          clashing with the collaborative nature of automotive manufacturing.
          </p>
        </div><div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">5.  Regulatory Complexity
          </h3>
          <p>
          Symptoms: Delays in road-testing autonomous vehicles and meeting compliance
          requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
          Root Cause: Apple’s inexperience with automotive regulations and safety standards.

          </p>
          <p>
          Contributing Factors: Rapidly evolving laws on autonomous vehicles and stringent safety
          requirements.

        </div><div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Financial Overhead
          </h3>
          <p>
          Symptoms: Mounting R&D costs led to scrutiny and internal debates.
          </p>
          <p>
          Root Cause: Lack of early revenue streams to offset expenditures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contributing Factors: Apple’s traditional model of delayed monetization clashing with the
            need for iterative funding in the automotive sector.
